# Gem Quest

This game is the result of a long weekend spent learning
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and the
[Phaser game](https://phaser.io) framework, with the objective of getting a
working game by the end of four days. It is inspired by games written on the
[BBC Microcomputer](http://beebwiki.mdfs.net/BBC_Micro), in particular
[Ebony Castle](http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=1052). The game is pretty
basic but some people might find it a tolerably entertaining diversion.

The game itself can be played [here](https://ajtribick.github.io/gemquest/).
